## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kay, A small developer who is trying to learn a lot of things

---

I'm a stupid software engineer and developer with skills ranging from front-end to back-end to database, and even some basic cloud service and those DevOps pipeline CI/CD operation.

Outside of tech, I was a content creator with more than 800k views on a single YouTube video, and nowadays I enjoy editing videos sometimes. I also love learning philosophy, reading books, and playing games.

ðŸ˜º If you wonder why I use inappropriate word like stupid in my repo or some document because that is my philosophy: Be stupid so you can learn from others more easily.
